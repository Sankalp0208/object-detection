# Object-detection using ANN<br>

A project for detecting objects in images and videos using deep learning techniques.<br>

This repository implements an object detection model to identify and localize objects within images or video frames. The model can be trained on a custom dataset or used with pretrained weights (e.g., on COCO)<br>
